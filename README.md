# COBOL Examples 
This is a collection of example and test COBOL programs I've written. I'm currently in the process of updating 
each folder with a README.md file and more comments so that the examples are easier to follow along with.


All program were written using [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) in Linux.
